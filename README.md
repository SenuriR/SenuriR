The best way to learn is to build!
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SenuriR
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum information science, physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - I'm building mini projects to learn MySQL, React Native, and Node.js. I'm also building a GUI from PyQt5 for a quantum information lab (more on that soon!).

The best way to learn is to build!
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SenuriR
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and nanotechnology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - I'm building projects to learn more about quantum transport and possible applications of ai/ml in this field. I'm also building a MVC application from PyQt5 for a quantum information lab (more on that soon!).
